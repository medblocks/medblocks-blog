# Introduction
It is a common need to automatically generate forms from openEHR templates. A well known example is the Better EHR Studio. It offers a Form Builder and an AQL Builder. However, there is no open-source alternative especially for low resource enviroments where an expensive openEHR provider is not affordable.

I have been working on this problem for a while, and today I'm making medblocks-ui repository open-source.
